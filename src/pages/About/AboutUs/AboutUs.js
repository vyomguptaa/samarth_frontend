Society has had a reflectance towards people with disabilities and has had reservations about them becoming self-sufficient parts of the community.</p>

                        <p className='text-center text-2xl mt-10'>This idea comes from a very personal space for us, as seeing the plight of people with being unable to express themselves in the corporate world is very saddening; there are not a lot of resources for the same.</p>

                        <p className='text-center text-2xl mt-10'>Employment means being committed to participation in an activity with others and an occupational identity. For people with a disability, such aspects are even more important, largely because these individuals have become an increasingly marginalized group in contemporary working life, with its great demands for education, flexibility, and productivity.</p>

                        <p className='text-center text-2xl mt-10'>At Samarth, we intend to support people with disability by giving them opportunities rather than sympathy. They want to feel that they are needed by others and that what they do is meaningful, in both their own eyes and in the eyes of others. We want to give them this opportunity to show their potential.</p>
